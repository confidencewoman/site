## Five Years Ago


### Hotel

Amaranth would just as soon not have been in the swamp town of Kyravasti, surrounded by miles and miles of soggy land and turbid water, moss-draped trees shrouding it in greenish darkness even in mid-afternoon. It reminded Amaranth of the home she'd left far, far behind: great place to live, if you were a land eel. It was a wonder anyone chose to work here, and a mystery what Vyruth Power & Mana was paying them to work on. But someone wanted to know, and they wanted to know badly enough that they had managed to contact Amaranth, and shown Amaranth a number with a dollar sign in front of it and enough zeros after it to engage her enthusiasm for Kyravasti, and so she and Jade were here, working out how to get the information that would make that number theirs.

She looked over at Jade, who was sitting at a table in their hotel room, busy grinding dried flowers in a mortar, gods and Jade alone knew for what. Amaranth let her gaze linger; it was a nice view. They'd rolled up their sleeves in deference to the heat and humidity, showing muscled arms from shoulders down to their ever-present gloves. Those arms were covered in a fascinating mesh of both arcane and artistic tattoos, dark lines on their warm brown skin rippling as they worked the pestle.

They said, "I can feel you looking at me, Amaranth."

"Lucky guess. Not much else worth looking at around here."

"Whatcha thinking?"

"I'm thinking we've got this VP&M facility out in the worst part of the swamp, and I don't much feel like getting my shoes wet," Amaranth mused. "I don't suppose you can just magic us in and out after hours?"

Jade stopped grinding and put the pestle down across the top of the mortar. "You want the long version or the short?"

"Short. Let's say, last time I was through a portal terminal, I was paying more attention to the cutie in front of me than the safety posters."

They said, "There's a lot of exciting ways to die trying, doll. We ain't got enough intel for me to tell you yeah or nah."

Amaranth shrugged. "All right. Thought I'd ask."

"Reasonable thought."

"We'll get that intel, then. This was already looking like we'd need an insider, so let's go shopping for one." She paused, curious. "What's with the flowers, anyway? Got a potion going?"

Jade stretched, lacing their gloved hands together above their head. They smiled, picked up the pestle again. "After a fashion, darlin'. I've been doing my own cologne."


### Front desk

She made her way down two flights of spiral wrought-iron stairs, sandal steps ringing on the metal, the only noise in the humid air. A bored-looking woman behind the front desk perked up slightly at her approach, put down the brochure she was fanning herself with. She had dark hair braided to keep it off her face, and a nice button nose.

Amaranth smiled her broad smile and told her, "So I'm looking to unwind a little. Micrata's had me running all over, but lucky me, got a break in the schedule for a few days. What's Kyravasti do at night?"

The clerk said, "Well, ma'am, the Ziggurat is very popular with tourists and businesspeople. Fantastic seafood, excellent selection of wines. Short walk from here down the main road, although," she looked Amaranth up, and down, and up, and down again, assessing, "I can ring our driver and have him take you and anyone that might be accompanying you there for a nominal fee, and they can call us and have him pick you up afterwards. Those are lovely sandals, ma'am; be a shame to get mud on them, and it's been drizzling on and off all afternoon."

"Aww, thank you, honey. And that was a lovely upsell. One saleswoman to another. Might take you up on it tomorrow." Amaranth smiled again, leaned in conspiratorially, putting her elbow on the desk. "Looking to unwind a little further than that. See some local color."

The clerk raised an eyebrow. "Ma'am?"

"Where do _you_ go on your day off?"

"Well, there's the Club, but—"

"This club have a name?"

"It's actually just called the Club. It really might be a little low-rent for you, ma'am," and the clerk leaned towards Amaranth, mirroring her. She said in a low voice, "I wouldn't go there without my fiance, is what I'm saying."

"Sounds perfect." Amaranth slid a twenty over the desk; the clerk nodded happily and pocketed it. "You know what, ring that driver and tell him I'll be ready in a half hour. Two people. Bill it to the room."

"Yes, ma'am! Thank you! Pleasure to help."

"Pleasure's all mine," Amaranth told her, and meant it. This felt like a lead, and for sure the cute little clerk wasn't getting paid enough to put up with this heat. Amaranth believed in sharing the wealth. Especially other people's.


### The Club

Tires squelched in the mud as the black sedan pulled up to the edge of what passed for a curb in this part of Kyravasti. Mud slightly higher and more solid than the other mud, perhaps. The driver put the parking brake on, came around to open the door for Amaranth. She took his proffered hand with a smile, grateful for the assistance with unfolding herself from the back seat, which hadn't really had enough room for a woman of Amaranth's stature. Once vertical, she turned slowly on the wooden sidewalk, taking in the surroundings as she straightened out the rumpled pleats of her tea-length dress.

One driver, currently learning that Jade didn't need any damn help out of the car, thank you very much. One ancient sedan, black, paint rusted and chipped around the wheel wells. Two gas-fired street lamps, each haloed with its own busy swarm of marsh insects vying to incinerate themselves. A boardwalk leading over the uneven ground of what might have been a lawn once, towards a huge house, shingled in white, faced with columns supporting open galleries on the higher floors. And the omnipresent swamp itself. It was late, the sun was setting, and it was still too damn hot.

She could hear the faint bass thump of Meridian funk; even as she listened, it was cut off, replaced by the even fainter strains of the horn section of a piece of Raoçao salsa that had been inescapable on the airwaves three years ago. Now _that_ brought back memories. She smiled again in the twilight, but a private smile, for herself only.

Amaranth turned back to the driver and ascertained that yes, The Club had the means of calling their hotel when they'd had enough and wanted a ride home. She slipped him a ten, letting him see a few larger-denomination bills on her money clip so he wouldn't decide to go to bed early. He lifted his cap briefly, and then he and the car made a broad arc in the street and went back the way they'd come.

She recognized the trumpet-shaped white flowers of night jessamine in the bushes around the lamps, plucked a sprig, inhaled the scent. As she braided it skillfully into her long blonde hair, she said, "Y'know, Jade, this feels like our kinda place."

"You say that almost everywhere we go."

"Well, it's true. How do I look?"

The mage flicked their eyes up and down. "Tourist. With money. And some taste. How much of our last payout are you wearing, anyway?"

"Enough to look like I can buy my own drinks." She turned in an impulsive half-spin, metal and gemstones glinting with the yellow-orange gaslight at her wrists, ears, throat. "And then a little extra for me." She checked the white floral-print fabric of her dress, cinched the broad maroon leather belt a little tighter. "You're not so bad yourself."

"Yeah? How do _I_ look?"

Jade wore black slacks with razor creases, black leather shoes polished to mirror shine, and a white dress shirt, sleeves down and cuffs linked in open defiance of the heat. Amaranth envied their ease in the tropical humidity. She'd only ever seen Jade sweat on two occasions: in bad magic trouble, holding a complex spell together with personal mana and sheer willpower, and in bed, which she was happy to take some of the credit for.

"Corporate… but not from here, and not here long. And honestly? Damn sharp, that's how. Shall we go?"

Satisfied, they offered her an arm. She took it and let them walk her down the path.


### Entrance

The boardwalk ended in a garden gone to riot. More jessamine contended with wisteria, honeysuckle, true jasmine, who knew what else. If this place had been properly gardened within the last decade, Amaranth would have been surprised. The black-clad bouncer standing at an improvised podium by the front steps looked a little better groomed, but not much. He eyed them briefly over a sizable beard, waved them past without saying anything.

There were gaslamps inside too, but they were all dimmed, accentuating the darkness more than illuminating it. People passed them in ones and twos, few lingering in the entryway for long. 

A huge chalkboard schedule on one side of the once-grand marble foyer listed the glories of Kyravasti after dark, glowchalk letters blazing neon in the half-gloom, the largest simply listing only the day and the hours, others enumerating a catalog of minor vices. Some Amaranth was familiar with and approved of, a few she hadn't gotten to know yet but thought she'd enjoy anyway, one or two that she intended to pass on. "Crabnobbing" sounded suspect, for one.

At her side, Jade mirrored her thoughts: "Lot going on here."

"Well now," she said, "if the alternative was hanging around an office after dark in the middle of nowhere with a VP&M leash around my neck, I'd be here too. Split up and look around?"

The mage crossed their arms and gave her a dubious expression. "Split up, hell. With you looking this good, in this pit of a town?"

"Only way anyone's talking to me. And I could say the same thing to you, Mx. Spit and Polish." Amaranth raised an eyebrow, displayed a faintly proprietary grin as she took in the mage's compact lines and snappy duds again. "Go. Mingle." She waved Jade off with a grand sweep of her arm. "Try not to start anything we can't afford to finish."

They laughed. "We pull this off, that line won't work so good after."


### The bar

Amaranth didn't have to work too hard to find a bar: the carpet was worn thin on the path to a parlor further into the first floor of the enormous house. Inside, two cocktail jockeys were juggling bottles and shakers behind a triple arc of dark wood counter, bar stools, and drunks; someone had chalked up a list of specials and hung it from a half-functioning chandelier. Mixed crowd, some looking monied, some looking cheap, most somewhere in the middle, atmosphere convivial, or at least nobody seemed to be spoiling for a fight this early. She'd blend just fine. The throng failed to part at her arrival, but it didn't seem like Kyravasti was big on queueing, so she excuse-me'd and elbowed her way close enough to one of the bartenders to catch his eye.

He smiled. "What can I get you, miss?"

"Well, hello there!" she said cheerily.

A tall man in a well-cut pinstriped vest to her left turned and inserted himself into the conversation. "Well, hey there yourself, pretty stranger. What are you drinking?"

He would do just fine to start. She smiled her broad smile, brushed a stray bit of hair back behind her ear.

"I suppose I'll kick the night off with, hmm, help me out here? Evening like this, you think a Wildcat or a Flagship is going to go down smoother?"

This was a test; the Wildcat was a syrupy-sweet nightmare consisting of a generous quantity of cheap rum buried under enough sugar, fruit, and ice that a tourist wouldn't notice how cheap the rum was, while the Flagship was quite a decent sippable cocktail, and also cost twice as much.

Pinstripes told the bartender, "Make the lady a Flagship, Harry, my tab." Test passed. First one, anyway.

"Coming right up, sir, miss." The bartender began by swirling brandy around the bottom of a snifter, which was how you started a proper Flagship. Amaranth made a note to tip the man if her new companion failed to.

She took a quick assessing glance at Pinstripes. Nice clothes. Guessed middle management, with an option on higher.

"Why, thank you. This is my first time through Kyravasti; if I'd realized the folks here were so nice, I'd have come through sooner. Whom do I have the pleasure of making the acquaintance of tonight?"

"Jason Sumont-Carmier," Pinstripes said, as if it were some sort of accomplishment.

"Amaranth," she said, reaching out a hand to receive her Flagship just as the bartender finished making it. She lifted the snifter to her nose, took in the scents of whiskey, brandy, cedar bitters, found it to her liking, then made a motion with the glass in the direction of Pinstripes' own. "To new friends and fortune. Cheers!"

"Cheers," Pinstripes agreed. Glasses clinked. They sipped.

"So, tell me, Jason," she began, "how did you find yourself here in Kyravasti?"

He said, "Well, it all started when the Company realized they were short on vision," and proceeded to tell an absolutely soporific tale of what amounted to a family connection landing him what was indeed a middle management job here in the swamp: his uncle played squash with the VP&M CFO's uncle, truly an absolutely incredible riches to riches story for the ages.

Amaranth kept him going with the occasional batted eyelash, wide-eyed "No, really?", stunned "That's amazing!", practically automatic for her, while she soaked in everything he said just in case there was a single thing she could use, but it amounted to zilch. She had no use for a guy who managed the people who managed the people who managed VP&M's paper clips, and more importantly, who apparently had no dreams bigger than his next fishing trip, which he was trying very hard and very badly to get her to accompany him on. At the revelation that _this quarter_ he was going to get an _11-foot_ marlin and break his personal best, she put a hand to her mouth in faux shock just in time to cover a genuine yawn. It was time to disengage.

"Well, that is _fascinating_," she said. "I had no idea deep-sea fishing was so involved. I wish you luck, Jacob! Sadly, it's much too late to change my travel plans for next week. If we bump into each other in the future and the uncles align, please introduce me to the CFO, but for now I plan to get the most out of the sights of Kyravasti while I'm here."

"It's Jason, actually," he said. "What a shame. How about your plans for later tonight? I can have the Club ring my driver, and there will be a Dasin IV here for us in twenty minutes. No finer way to, uh, see the sights."

"The new arcane coupe? Mm. Tempting, Jacob, but I came to the Club to see the sights _here_, and I'm not about to leave just yet. Please excuse me." She turned slightly and began studying the other occupants of the bar.

"It's…" Pinstripes' eyes flashed with brief anger, obvious even in her peripheral vision, but then he looked around. There were plenty of other men in the room, not a lot of women, and Amaranth was unquestionably the hottest thing going tonight. If he started trouble, it'd be coming back at him fast. "Never mind," he muttered, departing.


### Nev

"Wow," said the little bearded guy on her other side, "that guy crashed and burned, huh."

"Pardon?"

"Sorry. Couldn't help overhearing about ten minutes of talking about how big his marlin was. What a blowhard."

Amaranth laughed. "Well, you know what they say. It's not the _size_ of the marlin…"

"It's how you use it! Hi. Neville. Friends call me Nev."

"Amaranth. Friends call me Amaranth. Are we going to be friends, Neville?" Amaranth smiled wide, just a little bit smug, knowing that this guy had seen someone else totally fail to impress just a minute ago, thought he had a better shot, and just couldn't wait to take it. It was good to be her.

"It does seem possible. Whatcha drinking, Amaranth?"

"Flagship," she said. "Wouldn't mind another, provided it comes with a more interesting conversation?"

"Right on. Harry? Flagship for the pretty blonde." The bartender nodded, started mixing another. "So. Sightseeing in Kyravasti. Either your travel agent is a hundred years behind the times, or you're here on business, am I right?"

"You're an observant one," Amaranth said. "It is business."

"Oh yeah? Mind if I ask what line you're in?"

She looked him over, scanning for any signs that she was about to take a drink from someone who got paid to be professionally observant. Khaki slacks, a rather loud patterned shirt, not much in the way of muscles, but… ah. Shoes capable of holding a polish, and yet, no polish in evidence. Good sign. In her experience, undercover security people seemed to have trouble breaking that habit. She'd keep playing this straight for now.

"Precision small parts," she said. "Ever heard of Micrata?"

"Can't say that I have," he said.

Since she'd invented Micrata from whole cloth two weeks ago, she wasn't surprised. "Give it a year. You will. Zevix already has; their Automaton Works people are good, but they needed us to even dream of making more than one mechanical man a month. But you didn't hear that from me," she said conspiratorially, "and besides, I'm not on the clock tonight. Although if you know anyone who works with VP&M's technical departments that could give me the lay of the land, I sure would appreciate an introduction… and so would Micrata, you know what I mean?"

"Ah, you know, I actually am with the tech branch. But I'm not on the clock either."

"Then let's skip the business and talk leisure, Nev. What do you do for fun? What's hot in Kyravasti, other than the afternoons?"

"You're looking at a lot of it. Nightlife's here, just a bunch of VP&M folks trying to make some human connections, mostly. But let me tell you," Neville said, "sometimes you just gotta get out of town. So what I do for fun is poke around the ruins with some of the boys. And I'm not talking about the old marsh cotton era stuff like this place. I'm talking further out, way further back, before the swamp. Think centuries," he said, voice dropping into a whisper. "Think black stone pyramids, get me?"

"Lizardfolk," she said, matching him. As many superstitions about them as about her own people, but unlike the fae, they were gone, as far as anyone knew, and the accidents that happened around their remains were what kept the superstitions going.

"Ah, I could tell you were educated. Maybe them. Maybe a vassal state, don't really know. The scalies never let any of their serfs carve themselves into the records. The parts above ground are pretty picked over from the last few centuries, but me and the boys, we find some stuff once in a while, and I got plans to go deeper, maybe find some bigger artifacts still working under the mud. And there's a lot of carvings and such still accessible. And potentially even saleable. 'Course, this is all extremely…" he waved his drink around vaguely. "Unofficial. So I'm scratching around with hand tools, hoping I get lucky."

"Nev, I gotta say, I'm impressed," Amaranth said. "Never would have pegged you for an amateur archaeologist." She had to suppress the urge to say _tomb raider_. Neville seemed like he'd take it hard if she impugned his no-doubt sterling professionalism.

"Guess I don't look the part." Neville took a chug from his cocktail, eyed her curiously, probably working out how much longer he could hold her interest. "I could show you some of the stuff I've brought home."

"Might take you up on that," she said, leaning towards him, close enough that he could probably smell the flowers in her hair. "I got to see some lizardfolk stuff in the big museum in Stith once, sure leaves an impression."

"I bet you didn't get to see anything _running_, or some of the more out-there murals or frescoes, for that matter. I've found stuff that they wouldn't dare show in downtown Stith, _and_ I know how to work it. Worth the visit, I swear."

"We'll see where the night goes," she said, lacing her voice with promise. "You ever think about making this more than a hobby? Sounds like you're pretty good at it, Nev."

"Oh, sure." He took another chug. "I got a good job with the company and they keep me pretty busy, but the kind of equipment I'd need is a serious chunk of cash. Plus I don't think the company'd take it well if I started digging around their back yard full-time."

"You'd need to stay out of VP&M's sights. You'd need to be clever, careful, quiet, well-funded. Sounds like you've got the first three down so far." Amaranth smiled her broad smile, held it until she got a faint echo from Neville. She was absolutely sure she had his attention. "Suppose I told you I had an expense account that could make that a lot easier, provided Micrata got that introduction. Oh, but we're neither of us on the clock, so never mind."

The little bearded man considered it. "Suppose you did, Amaranth. Perhaps, if you did, we'd have to meet somewhere a little quieter and talk over what might be involved."

"I'd like that, Nev. I'd like that very much." She lifted her near-empty glass. "Cheers."

"Cheers."

They clinked their glasses together, a small sound in the background noise of the bar.

"Well then. Nev, would you excuse me for a bit? I'll find you after, but I need to powder my nose."

She'd been watching, and Neville hadn't tipped the bartender either. She left a tenner under her empty glass as she pushed it across the bar towards Harry, and left to find Jade.


### Upstairs

Amaranth wasn't in any particular hurry. She slowly ascended a grand staircase towards the back of the club, taking in some of the mood on the way. A few men trudged down the stairs in the other direction, looking like they'd just bet the rent money and lost; others, seeming more hopeful, passed her on the way up.

The second floor was marginally less shabby than the first, the gaslamps brighter, the carpet still showing the original floral patterns. There were easily a dozen rooms opening onto the hallway, excited cheers coming from several. She strode past the first one, where several poker games were in progress; past a second, where she briefly lingered, trying to decipher a complex game involving dice and little figurines. Third one was the charm: she heard "Ah, hard turn, fella," in a familiar voice, and followed it in.

She wasn't sure what she'd walked into. It had been a drawing room once, but the posh furniture had been scattered around the room, and then someone had nailed yards and yards of complicated twisting track to the furniture and the walls, over and under, looping around and around and around the room until there wasn't much space in it for anything else. Jade was in a small knot of very intent people, all holding hand-sized arcs of metal or bone, each one glowing with a projected glyph of a different color.

Then she saw the same colors, zipping along the track. Racing game of some sort. Didn't take her long after that to spot the finish line, and Jade's green glow was closing on it fast, but a pink glow seemed to have them beat. A yard from the finish, the track erupted in green lightning and the pink glow stopped dead. The green cruised past it. A bell rang.

"Well, hell. Looks like you had a card left after all," the pink racer said. Another bell rang as his pink crept over the line.

"Mighta been in trouble if you'd still had a shield. Thanks for popping that for me, Sten. Give my regards to last place, buddy," Jade said. They put down their control arc, shook hands with the other racers. "Oh, hi, Amaranth. Boys, it's been a pleasure, but my good luck charm is here, and you don't wanna race me when she's by my side. Put you all in the poorhouse quick."

Amaranth felt the gaze of everybody in the room as they all turned to look. Someone actually whistled. She grinned. "Hello again, Jade."

"Ref, what am I up on points?"

"Forty, Jade."

"Great. Cash me out, will you? I'm gonna treat this lovely lady to a drink."

In the hallway, Amaranth asked, "What was I just watching?"

"Oh, you ever play with racing micros? Tiny lil' charmed models with remote controls. It's a mage-game mostly, since the real point is to cheat as much as you can but make it look good."

"Gotcha. So what's your read on the local arcane talent, then?"

"They didn't catch me splitting that lightning card so I could use it twice. Among other things. I mean, they're competent enough for desk jockeys, there's some power there, but no speed, no fluidity, you get me? Jesse, the guy with the pink controller, he tried to pull some gravity redirection trick last race, but it took him so long to set up that I shut that down before it really got going. Surprisingly little arcane artistry around this place. Either VP&M ain't hiring the best mages, or they ain't spending their weekends here."

They paused to see if Amaranth was still paying attention; she nodded.

"The biggest piece of magic I've seen outside that room is the sound system. Definitely a hybrid. I could blow the whole damn thing if we need to." They waved at a green crystal on the wall, wrapped in a spiral of brass wire, visibly vibrating to the music.

"Let's try not to need to, Jade. You talk to anyone we might wanna talk to again?"

"Mm. Not really. You do any better downstairs?"

"One prospect. Guy named Neville with an expensive hobby and a mind to get me in bed. Told him I'd find him later."

"I'm not hearing a thrill in your voice, Amaranth."

"There is no thrill in my voice, Jade. Not yet, anyway."

"We keep looking?"

"Night's still young. Speaking of sound systems, I think the band's live. Let's go check them out."


### The ballroom

Back on the first floor, they entered an old ballroom through wide double doors. Huge mirrors made the place look even bigger. The music stopped for a moment; Amaranth heard the clack of her own shoes on the hardwood parquetry. The Club must have been quite something as a private residence, she mused. The crowd in the ballroom was sparse, a few dozen in a place that could have easily held a few hundred. There were a few scattered high tables here and there, really just places for people to rest their drinks.

There was a band platform at the other end, but no band. The left side was taken up mostly by crates upon crates of vinyl phonorecords; to the side of the crates, a skinny guy in a faded T-shirt and thick glasses managed two phonographs on a desk. A much bigger green crystal sat under the desk, pulsing visibly. The right side of the stage was empty, except for a mic stand, and a panel of blue glass, hanging from the ceiling.

"Guess I was half right," she said. "Singer's live, band isn't. You up for some karaoke, Jade?"

"Hell, no. My low range is shit and I sound like a fuckin' girl in high range. But I'll watch _you_ sing any day of the week."

Amaranth scanned the crowd, trying to guess who would step up next. It was definitely slower in here than the bar, or the gaming rooms upstairs. People were drifting in and out, some still wearing office outfits, others down to jeans or minidresses, most holding drinks. There was a dark-eyed girl up front wearing a short skirt, booties, and an impatient expression that was her favorite for next singer.

The person who eventually stepped onto the stage was someone she'd barely noticed. He'd been sort of lurking near one side of the room, waiting for his slot, she supposed. Medium height, dark, a little hairy, short brown hair cut on the shaggy side, standing posture more of a slump. But he took the stage like he owned it, straightening up even as he took the mic, black leather jacket open and showing off a faded green logo tee over some muscles. And he grinned. He grinned like someone who belonged there. Amaranth couldn't help but smile back, just so the guy knew, if he was looking, that someone appreciated what was going on up on stage.

The blue glass panel lit up with words as the KJ dropped the needle: "Kicked Out of Paradise."

"All _right_," Amaranth said quietly.

> "I lived a good life
> I did all the good things
> Died and went to heaven
> Earned an angel's wings
> Then last night I saw you
> From my heavenly cloud
> Curves like a demon
> Babe I want you out loud
> They'll call me up next morning
> And they'll judge all my sins
> I'm getting…"

Amaranth clapped three times along with the recorded drums, because that's what you _did_ when Goldwyrm was playing.

The singer finished the first verse:

> "Kicked out of paradise
> For sneakin' you in!"

During the first solo, Jade said, "Don't know this one. Should I?"

"It's _Goldwyrm_! They are the _kings_ of cock rock. But no, you would have been away when they got big."

"Eh, not really my thing, but if it gets you _this_ excited…" They leered.

She laughed and punched them in the arm.

The singer burned through the chorus, the next few verses. Amaranth caught his eyes briefly. He was still grinning. The last verse went _high_, but this guy had some solid pipes. Didn't miss a note.

He finished to scattered applause from a crowd that, Amaranth felt, did not appreciate what was going on up there.


### White Dress

The KJ stood, grabbed his own mic, exhorted the room to show some love: "C'mon, people, give it up for the best Goldwyrm since Goldwyrm!" A few more claps. "All right. Next up, we got Rozz."

Silence.

"Rozz? We got a Rozz around here? They're gonna miss their spot if they're not on stage in twenty seconds."

Folks shrugged. Wherever Rozz was, they weren't coming.

"Hey," Jade said, "you wanna be Rozz for an evening? Jump the line?"

"Shush. Not yet. Haven't seen all I wanna see."

The singer said, "If the next act got lost, Grant, I got another one in me. Let's keep these people entertained. Pull up A398?"

"Sure, you got it," the KJ replied, rummaging through discs. "Okay, y'all, this is an oldie, but it's a goodie. Take it away." He dropped the needle. The glass flashed with the title: "White Dress, Black Skies, Blue Lips, No Lies."

"Shit, I know _this_ one!" Jade said.

"Oh yeah?"

"Yeah. Girl group called the Electrettes. Used to sing along to it on the radio back in _high school_," they continued. "Damn, but that brings back memories."

This one was a slower number. The singer's swagger faded; he hugged the mic with both hands, as if it was the last source of heat in a cold winter. He began:

> "It's the end of everything, and the air is freezing
> Winter is your favourite time of year
> I promised you I'd never stop believing
> You promised me that you would find me here
> And now my soul is spinning with the seasons
> The crowds have all packed up their smiles and cheer
> The Sun goes down and I'm alone and grieving
> Still at the altar, waiting for you, dear."

It seemed it was Jade's turn to get lost in the performance on stage.

Amaranth elbowed them. "You're staring."

"So are you."

She nodded. She'd been thinking as much as staring, but she couldn't deny the essential truth.

"Yeah, and I'm thinking if she has any more access than the last sad sack I talked to, she's our gal."

"_She?_" the mage asked. "You're sure?"

"Jade," Amaranth said, "_I'd know._"

"Well, well, well," they muttered. "You'd know, that's fair. How, though?"

"First thing I noticed was the clothes."

"Okay. Those ain't company threads."

"Looks like she got changed after work, huh?"

"Not everybody in here bothered. Wonder why?"

"Because it matters to _her_. Fashion conscious. Maybe doesn't like the VP&M dress code. Maybe doesn't wanna be in a suit and tie a second longer than she has to be to keep her job."

"Mm," Jade assented. "Leather jacket, leather boots. Likes looking dangerous?"

"Or just likes the smell, the feel. It's a sexy material."

"Don't have to tell me twice, Amaranth. I remember last month." They waggled raised eyebrows.

"Quiet, you," Amaranth snickered. "But just listen for a bit. Check out her vibe."

They watched. The singer continued:

> "I wish you lied to me, but I know better
> I know you'd rather hurt me with the truth
> Now I'm left with a—"

By the chorus, Jade was singing along. Very quietly, but one of the things anyone who got close to Amaranth eventually learned was that her pointy ears weren't just for show. She could hear a needle drop in a haystack.

> "White dress
> Black skies
> Blue lips
> No lies
> …and no you."

"Yeah, okay, she's really going at it," they admitted.

"More so than most of the schlubs in this place. And yet, look at the response," she said, indicating the ballroom in front of them with a sweep of her hand, where a whole lot of nothing was going on.

"Not a lot."

"She hasn't made any friends, then. Want to guess why?"

"Think she's not friendly?"

"Either it's personality or it's actions. I'm betting on both."

"She seems like a fun time right now."

"Look closer, Jade. Who's she performing for?"

"The dance floor, I guess."

"Not many people looking. She's just pouring it out, and aside from us, I don't know that half a dozen people have noticed. A lot of passion for a disinterested room. So either she's stupid, which she doesn't look, or she knows she's being wasted here."

"What, her karaoke skills?"

"This is her _self-expression_, Jade. This is what she's _got_. She's putting herself out there and nobody's seeing her. Who else do you see in a fucking leather jacket in this heat?"

"So she don't fit in."

"And she's not interested in fitting in. She'd rather be herself. She's singing for herself."

"And all this adds up to a _herself_? You think she knows?"

Amaranth crossed her arms and shook her head. "Yes, and maybe, in that order, and we better not tell her that _we_ know just yet, or she'll spook."

"Gonna be hard, because I think I believe you. So what does this mean?"

"Means she'll say yes, if it gets her out of this swamp to a place people can see _her_."

"Assuming she's gonna be at all useful to us."

"Assuming that, yes."

The song ended, and the singer stepped off the stage to a few half-hearted claps from the disinterested crowd. The impatient dark-eyed girl got on stage and started fussing with the mic stand.

"She sings so good, Amaranth. All right," Jade said. "'Scuse me, doll. Gonna go find out if she's a dud or not before I get any more interested. Watch my cocktail." They put it down on a table and started towards the stage.

"Excuse you? What? Jade—" The song must have broken them. Obviously. Unless it was the singer.

They flashed her a grin back. "I got a date with destiny, sorry!"

"The hell you do!"

Amaranth sighed. She checked her reflection in the dregs of Jade's drink, pulled some glasses and a headscarf out of her purse, fixed her lipstick, watched her own reflection go from bubbly tourist to hardass corporate without changing all that much. It was a gift.

Then she followed Jade, who was elbowing their way up to the stage and the singer with the black leather jacket. She could already hear the mage talking as they caught up with her.

"Hey, you fuckin' killed it up there. Anyone who knows the Electrettes is good in my book, but you landed 'White Dress' like Tanya Anodyne herself. Buy you a drink?"

"Liked it that much, huh?" The singer seemed curious, a little wary; not as sure of herself as she was on stage, and not sure what to make of Jade. They sized each other up.

"Liked it that much," Jade said. They wore a manic, singleminded grin. "Like to get to know the singer. Seems like a tough customer, though. Think I got a shot?"

There was a pause.

"Yeah, I dunno. Something about you makes it hard to trust you, buddy," she said, defensiveness as clear in her voice as it was in her arm-spreading posture. "For starters, you're fresh; for seconds, you look like some kinda Visconti impersonator, or maybe you're doing a rum runner bit, like from an old radio play? Kinda gets me worried a bit." She let that sink in for a moment, but continued, carrying the energy of the conversation forward. "Look, mister—"

"Ain't no mister," they said cheerily. "Name's Jade."

"Okay then. Nice to meet you, Jade," she said, clearly skeptical of the words coming out of her own mouth. "Tell you what: I'll let you buy me a drink if you tell me what you think comes after that."

"Let's say your crypto-punk look really pushes my buttons." They smirked. Amaranth knew that smirk. That smirk led to trouble. She'd found it to be the fun kind of trouble for her, but not always for everyone else.

"Yeah, okay," she said sarcastically. "What buttons? You trying to start something?" The singer dipped one hand into a pocket. Shit. You didn't draw on Jade, knife or pistol or whatever. The mage had a lot of nasty tricks, both up their sleeves and under their gloves.

"Well, that's not where I was goin', but now you're speaking my _other_ language, sweetcheeks. You wanna throw down here, or do we do this outside? Seems like an outside kinda town—"

It was about time for Amaranth to intervene before somebody got hurt. She stepped up to the two, off to one side a bit, in-between seeming like a bad idea just then. She said, "Sorry about my _business partner_. They get like this after too long on the road. Can't tell if they want to fight or fuck or both in either order. Tell the truth, it was actually me who wanted to talk to you."

The singer's expression softened fractionally as she saw Amaranth. Her hand slipped out of her pocket, empty. "Oh?"

"Ah, you're no fun, Amaranth," the mage said, still grinning, but the grin was fading.

"I can be," she said warmly. "Under the right circumstances." She turned to face the singer directly, trusting Jade would cool it. "I must admit you got my attention with that Goldwyrm song, but I honestly couldn't take my eyes off you during 'White Dress'. You could probably see me staring; been on the road a while myself. Just wanted to talk, is all."

The singer's eyes scanned over her, sizing her up the same way she'd sized up Jade, then making a second pass over certain parts of Amaranth that were hard to miss. Amaranth was used to that kind of attention, generally welcomed it, definitely used it. Not the brief expression of awe, however. That wasn't usual. _Gotcha_.

"No harm done yet," the singer said. She wasn't the kind of girl that blushed easy, but the way her eyes were wide, the way they kept shyly avoiding Amaranth's, that was as good as a blush. "Seems we at least share an interest in the Electrettes. Let's say I'm still listening."

"All right. Let _me_ get your next. Just a drink. There somewhere we can get a table, actually?"

"There's another bar on the third floor," the singer said. "Quieter. We could probably get a _two-person_ booth."

Up on stage, the dark-eyed girl was starting her song. Spectacle, anyway. She wasn't good. There was no possible key in which she could have been on key.
> "I got your number, darlin'
> I got your spectrum, babe
> You're clever burning delta white
> But I'm digging you a graaaaaaave—"

"Oh, _gods_,"Amaranth said. "She is _murdering_ Bitzen Pieces. Third floor sounds good."

"I'm sensing three's a crowd," Jade said. "Also, this chick can't sing for biscuits. Find you back at the company suite, Amaranth?"

"That'd be good, Jade."

With a wave, they faded into the crowd.

"Do you mind steering me in the direction of this upstairs bar?" Amaranth asked. "You seem like you know the place pretty well."

"Yeah, no worries." She kept sneaking glances at Amaranth, as if afraid she was going to evaporate. "I'm here most weekends. It's a left out the ballroom door…"


### Balcony bar

The spiral staircase was steep and uncarpeted, could have been a servants' access originally, but after a bit of a climb, they were on a balcony overlooking the marsh at the back of the house. The night had finally cooled enough for the swamp air to be pleasant on Amaranth's skin, and she recognized skeeterbane bushes in planters here and there. Probably they had a fancier name than that here, but call them what you would, they kept the bugs away, and they smelled nice too. A hostess seated them, pretty girl in a black skirt and white blouse. This felt like where money went, when money showed up to the Club. And indeed, the drinks weren't cheap.

The singer ordered aizan, a cloudy white spirit Amaranth had never actually had before, redolent of citrus and spice. The upstairs bar served it chilled in thick little glasses, rime condensing from the air. They talked music, why not?

Up close, Amaranth noticed closed holes in the singer's ears from piercings no longer worn, patches on the jacket for bands she knew, a few she didn't, a very few faded political slogans, and two outlines of stitch holes near those, where something had been removed. The jacket had some history. So, no doubt, did its wearer.

"Like I was saying," the singer opined, "you don't have to be a classical arcane tenor to sing Bitzen. Just barely competent will do. Their first vocalist had been a coal miner before the band, wasn't range _or_ magic they were selling."

"It's all about swagger, isn't it? Attitude." Amaranth gestured with her glass. "Stage presence. You have it."

"I did see you staring." The singer was a little more at ease up here. Amaranth decided she liked seeing her like this. "You have really pretty eyes…" She sighed. "Gods, I'm such an idiot. Why are you really talking to me? Your… business partner… they said you had a company suite, but I don't know you. Not VP&M. Vendor?"

"Micrata Custom Manufacturing," Amaranth said, "at your service. Look," she said, her eyes pleading, "yes, there are things Micrata would love to sell VP&M, things we'd love to pick up about business out here in Kyravasti. Maybe some other time I'd want to pick your brains about precision machine parts you need more of and the company's plans for the future. But we can also just enjoy some drinks together, can't we?"

The singer frowned, suddenly back on the defensive. "We could. But you should know that I got nothing to do with purchasing…" She leaned in towards Amaranth, scrutinizing her, finally convincing herself that she'd found the trap. "And I don't talk to press, either. I work on precision machinery, I know every big and small vendor on this continent because that's part of my job, to digest those big fat catalogs, and I've never heard of any Micrata."

"Aha," Amaranth said. "Busted."

"For what it's worth, I was hoping I was wrong." The singer leaned back and sighed. They finished their aizan in one slug. "Thanks for the drinks anyhow."

"Well, hey, good news, you're close, but you're still a little bit wrong. Wanna talk to enough money to get you out of this swamp for good, instead?"

"Fuck is this?" Eyes narrowed, no trust here. "You another one of those twerps from the main office's security branch? Swear you think we're all idiots out here in Kyravasti. I get it, you're new, you wanna make a point about leaks, you wanna get a few of us fired so it looks like you found some weak points? If this is your idea of a clever sting, I've seen cleverer. They might not take you back after, you know. Main office might _leave you out here with the rest of us swamp bumpkins_. You _and_ your goon." She crossed her arms with a slight creaking of leather.

"Nope," Amaranth said, matching the attitude she was getting across the table. She smiled, but not her usual broad invitation to join her in a moment's glee, more like a shark smiled when it knew it was about to get a mouthful of dinner. "Sorry to hear they like to mess with your heads out here, but actually, this is real simple. This is opportunity knocking. Now, you can call us in to local security, or you can call us into the main office. We're very good at what we do. Guarantee you we're gone. You're automatically suspect. They _might_ pay you a shit bonus, three months later, if you're lucky, for being very clever at spotting corporate spies. They _might_ cut your pay or fire you or, well, seems like there's a lot of marsh out here. You can say no, right here, and keep doing your job, and keep coming back to this club for the next, what, ten years, knowing it's your own damn fault for not taking an out when offered. Keep singing to rooms of people who don't really even notice. Or, you can come back to my hotel room, we can keep talking. You help us out, you can leave this damn swamp and not have to work for _years_."

Amaranth took a sip of her own aizan, raised her eyebrows in a subtle challenge. "That's the way it is. No more bullshit, just budget. Enough budget that I get some discretion about who I drink with, by the way, and I am actually enjoying the company. Still want to check with corporate?"

The singer still looked angry, but Amaranth was sure wheels were turning in her head.

"You got," she began, "a lot of nerve, lady."

"Yeah," Amaranth said, interrupting before she got any further, "I do. Qualification for the job. So do you, if I'm right. Go on. Tell me if I'm right." She took out her purse, unhurriedly rummaged through it for her lipstick, drew a number on her cocktail napkin, slid it across the table.

"That's a _number_," the singer said, taken aback.

"I'm not cheap," Amaranth told her. "Wouldn't expect you to be. So? Am I right?"

"You're… not wrong."

She was still processing. That was just fine. Amaranth felt certain that she'd come around, now that someone had laid out the facts, the likely truths of how companies like VP&M operated, and a little outright provocation. Some people needed to be pushed out of their old balance to find a new one, but they'd find the new one. Nev hadn't seemed like _anything_ could push him hard enough to not be fundamentally Nev, but the singer was different.

Amaranth beckoned the hostess over. "The check, please," she said, "and if you could call my hotel and let them know, two for pickup? Appreciate it."

The singer cocked her head. "'Two for pickup.' Just like that, huh? You think I'm that easy?"

"I think you want to be. Should be a _few_ things in life that're fun."

The singer opened her mouth to say something. Lips parted, nothing came out. Leather creaked again as she shifted in her seat. Then, "Look, I can't just come with you…"

"What's stopping you?" Amaranth asked with an inviting smile.

"My better judgement!"

"So let's convince your better judgment to go fuck off for a while. Your better judgment got you stuck here. The person I saw up on stage wanted to _live_ a little."

No retort, just a slightly dazed expression. Hells, the singer was as cute flustered as she was hot on stage. There was a fair bit to unpack here, but Amaranth wanted very much to help her unpack it. Amaranth's imagination had already started going, and she let her expression surface it: dreamy, eyes wide, full of genuine interest and pleasant possibilities for them.

"Fuck," the singer said quietly. "Okay. Even if I'm sure I'm gonna regret this."

Amaranth chuckled softly. She'd want to remember this moment of night air, orange gaslight, the citrus tang of aizan, the singer in her punky leather armor, the satisfaction of an evening ultimately well spent, and the anticipation of the night to come. "I don't think you will."

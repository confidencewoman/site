title: "Morning Announcements"

## Content warnings: D/s; hypnokink

You make an announcement. Aloud. Speech is good. It keeps you going in a direction when the internals start looping. In your powerful voice, you announce, you portend:

"My sleep schedule is _fucked_. But! I'm _getting somewhere_. So that's killer."

"Because academia is like that, _in_ my limited experience. Academia is the eternal balancing, it's tearing up the boards of the steamship and using them for fuel to make harbour. That's where I am now. I've got this _plan_. And it's impossible. But it's not, somehow."

"In a week, I'll have the paper _done_. Complete! Forever. And then I can sleep."

"_Aaand yeeet,_ I cannot conceive of existing, with a paper done, a week from now! What I _can_ conceive of, _just barely_, is drinking enough coffee, and getting enough sleep, to read through thirteen articles and one introduction of a group of collected essays on the cognitive science behind the perception of colour, _and_ make helpful notes to reference later. Not only that, I'm fuckin _jazzed_ about it. The coffee is helping with that, but this late in the game, I can see progress. I am Achieving Concrete Goals besides one book a day, which is a shitty _but necessary_ goal."

"And that is why! I! Am! Powering myself up in the mirror! _Baby!_"
  
"What is _up_, Rosalie! I am up! At noon! Which is plenty of time to read! So! _Great_! Job! Okay."

"And then! After that! I will even shave my damn ass _legs_!"

----------

"Whoof. hello gay Rosalie. It is but a day in Shakespeare's garden, and Shakespeare hast bitten thee on thine… leg, or something. Ugh. Bad job Rosalie, minus three points. Run a lap."

You lean on the counter.

"It."

That's a start. Direction.

"Would be good to have the time for this nonsense. But I don't. I don't. As much as I have feelings, I do not."

"What I _do_ have is awareness of O'Connor's principles of, fuckin, white balance and microtint, and there are the theories around ultraviolet, which, I know. I am actually _aware_ of that stuff, _and_ I have notes. So four days is, yes, less than I wanted, but. Cry me a river and all, I can't do anything else tonight, so I have to either try to sleep, or try to… do work, sooo…"

You play with the taps for a few seconds pointlessly, on and off in both hands, the way that fucks with the inner workings over time. Reading, writing, the entire scope of the project, sleep, shower, gender, the impossible chasm of the future, the weakness of your frame. You're looping, you've been silent for too long.

"So. Fuck it. Okay. What can I even _do_ right now. I can. Take a shower, and chill for a second, and decide."

Shower cap. Water on, wait for it to get hot. Bathroom fan. The habits, the ritual of the shower makes it hard to talk. Narrating your thoughts interrupts your half-thought actions. You try a couple of times.

"So. After this, um… maaaybe food? Have I eaten? I kinda had a meal… maybe should I order Indian?…"

You drop back into musing silently, though, and your body does the things it needs to do. Razor, shaving cream, warm your stomach under the hot water before you shave below. Your wandering mind tells you it's glad you've got these little affirming rituals, at least, and you resolve to order food and give up on figuring things out for now.

Lavender soap on the shelf as you shave. A lovely birthday purchase, a luxury that makes you smile every time you see it. Little floral touches for Rose-a-lee.

Hey, you're smiling! Great work, you! And then food, probably! Oh, oops, stopped shaving, next step. Shoulders. Does everyone have to shave their shoulders? You hear about shaving your _back_, but shoulders seem uncommon. You should ask Miranda.

You mean, later, obviously. That's decided.

Rinse, hot, soap, loofah. Scrub through the normal bodily paths that loop like a jumpsuit over and around your feet and then back up the backs of your thighs, the lower back and the places you can't quite reach alone. Rinse.

Just for a second, your hands and face press the cold shower wall. Just thirty seconds, feeling something between sexual energy from the ridiculous fuck-me pose and exhaustion held behind your eyes in strained pouches, letting the cool and the hot bathe you, germs be fucked. Just a bit, listening to the music of the shower.

Oh, it's music now!  
  
That's where you are in the sleep cycle. White noise becoming snatches of music. Sometimes it's radio voices announcing car commercials or football games, but you like the music best.

A little moment of beauty.

Your ear gets lost following hundreds of little threads, reminded of dozens of songs, drifting on the overwhelming soft wash of noise like ghosts in fogbanks.

You realize you've been listening to (imagining you're listening to) an old Jason Mraz song for what feels like half a chorus, and cackle at the absurdity as you warm your face in one last wash of hot water.

"It's the remedy, _baby_! Fuck yeah! It's the experience! It is extremely a very dangerous liaison!"

Your love of your own stupid, bold, confident voice fills the tiny, misty room, and you can't help laughing again.  
  
"Yeah fuckerman! I'm back! Indian food and probably even a fuckin _book_ after. I eat books for breakfast! And Indian for dinner!"

And like that, you're balancing again, not like the steamship captain weighing fuel against structural integrity. Like a bicyclist at full speed on a narrow path.

"The only trick is not stopping, right?"

----------

You stare into the mirror. Your eyes are wide, your skin is filthy. So _close_.

You're forgetting to breathe. You gasp air.

This is al

"most certainly because I haven't stopped." Mumbling is not great. Feeling oily is bad. So.

"Gotta shower. Edit shape. I will be _in_ it, and also, in the shower. Hell yes. Rosalie, baby, you done did it." Pants off, clothes following, messy pile. "So close."

Socks, underwear. "Full pot of coffee _maaay_ have been too much. No. Relevant. Necessary. I am _very_ smart." You giggle a bit. Keep yourself talking. Give yourself direction before you wander off. Shower! Filthy. Wake you up, get yourself a shave! "Hell yes."

"Hell. _Yes_."

Shower cap, glasses on. "Babe, I'm tryin," you murmur. Left a sock on, fix _that_. More coffee? "No. Shower time, baby girl. Gotta get in there."

"Listen," you slur. You do better, speechwise, stepping into the heat. "Listen, schweetheaht." That was on purpose so it's okay. "We both know you're barely holdin' it togethah. So. Fine. Soap an' stuff, and maybe… a nap? Nooo, nap is a bad idea. Mmph, need to ed-dit. So. So."

You are staring blankly at the razor. You don't have time for the razor. You don't have _attention_ for the razor. You can raze later. You'll call a TV station and hold a fund-razor.

Oooh this is _bad_. Soap. Soap face. Habit begins. "Yesss. Lavender." Soap across you in silence, your brain hardly holding onto anything.

It's a bit foggy, actually. Oh, yeah, glasses still on. For razor. You grumble and toss them onto the laundry heap. You miss and they clatter across the hard tiles but they're fine. Fuck. Soap. More soap. Not using the loofah. You groan in frustration, but hell, you're almost done now and at _least_ this will get the academic _sweat_ smell of the all nighter off of you.

"Too many coffee times."

There. Rinsing clean. Front…

Back.

Front again, listening, because something. Is that the Carpenters? Or someone covering the Carpenters. No, now it's "Lovefool". Which is the Cardigans, not the Carpenters, but close. Oh, and now it's that orchestral bit from the Beatles, the one song. With the yellow matter custard gross bit?

You surprise yourself with the press of the cold corner of the shower stall against your back and ass. Losing your balance is also _bad_, but a determined part of you knows you can't go to sleep yet. Standing here might be as much as you can manage for a minute or two.

Don't slip.

The music is still there with you, though, and you don't want to talk or snap yourself out of this half-daze in case it goes away, because it's beautiful today. Strings arpeggiate thick, beautiful chords. Shadow voices hum and cross over and back again in loops, open into luxurious, unafraid vowels, shimmer as they become brass sections that move in soppy, overdramatic unison, no oom-pahs here. Everywhere you direct your attention there is something, so you don't, you let it wash you as the water washes you.

You think, _Is this dying? Am I dying?_

You think, _If I am, it's beautiful_, and you don't move.

The throb of the music is like crystals shaking together, like wind chimes strung together into nature's gamelan, and you wish you had the brain to understand any of it, and then that's swept away in wonder too with the hum of what is both radio static and impossibly a terribly beautiful sequence of chords buzzing fruit scents and lightning into the air sweet April mornings bright grandfather clocks the sound is become all senses black and yellow spinning glorious disco ball spearmint moan and soft, soft thunder until in an instant you have seen her and before you know it it stops

You do not know how long it takes you to come back into your mind, but you dimly register that by the time it happens, _she_ has straightened and is facing you. You hardly know how you know she is _she_, because she is a dimly curling shape in the shower-fog, slim shoulders and hair that drifts to one side, the suggestion of eyes where drops patter off or through her and glimmer. Then you remember you heard it through the music.

You wish you had your glasses, but you're not moving. It's you and her, and the music has stopped, and you know what that means because you've heard enough of her song.

The shower hisses and splats without _her_ voice, and you miss it achingly already. Deeply. You're speaking.

"Please don't go. Please stay."

The woman in front of you… _you don't have your glasses_ you wish you could read her expression, but in fog and myopia she is a double suggestion, and so you don't realize she has come closer until you feel

_something_

on your ear, thrilling like a drop of ice cold water as your nerves try to understand, and then

close to you

she sings.

----------

You awaken—

No.

You _come to_ in the computer chair, three-quarters through your editing, dressed in fresh clothes, and somehow it feels impossible to stop, which makes sense, after all you're on a _roll_, and then the thing is done and it's only 1PM, plenty of time to go drop it off and head back home, and you're on the bus, and you're home, and you've done it, your stomach is full of lunch, and it's time to sleep, but first, you walk into the bathroom and stare into the mirror, not quite believing it happened, that you did it all, that

you never

do your makeup

when you go out.

Gingerly you close the bathroom door. You remove your clean clothes reverentially, fold them, place them on top of the laundry pile (you are not leaving the bathroom now, not on the cusp of this). Your hand moves to the water-stained steel shower faucet, badly cleaned four months ago, and hesitates. But you've always needed to know answers to terrible questions, and so, Rosalie, you turn the faucet on and leave the bathroom fan off, like you did this morning, and you steel yourself, and you step into the shower.

A minute passes, and there is no music. Your chest grows heavy with the heartbreak of it, with one beautiful hallucination ardently believed. Sleep deprivation has made a fool of you, and the pouches behind your eyes start to hurt with the power of your own deception.

But of course you can't give up here, and so you open your mouth to say,

That is—

You want to say,

…something, but nothing comes out;

and as you think back over the course of the day, you can't remember speaking to keep yourself on track. You remember direction, and doing what was necessary; you remember being at peace and powerful.

You can't remember speaking at _all_ since this morning, and when the music returns, behind you, close in your ear, a part of you in the thrill recognizes a new member of the spectral choir, before you are gently washed clean of thought and the thrill is all that is left.
